# Aperture Viewer: Development Fork for Pioneering Visual Experimentation (Based on Firestorm)

**Independent Development - Test Releases, Learning Hub**

> [!NOTE]
> This project and its GitHub serve as a learning hub for advanced visual techniques and user feedback, in addition to being a testbed for new features.

Aperture Viewer is an independent fork of Firestorm by William Weaver, created for **novel visual feature exploration** in Second Life and OpenSim.  Not an official Firestorm project and not intended to compete, Aperture Viewer is a personal testbed, built on Firestorm, for developing and testing features with user feedback.  Aperture Viewer and its GitHub also function as a learning hub, to:

*   **Investigate Advanced Visual Techniques:** Explore innovative graphics enhancements in Second Life/OpenSim.
*   **Develop & Refine Artistic Tools:** Enhance Phototools and visual controls for advanced image creation.
*   **Gather User Feedback:** Offer a public platform to test and provide input on new features.

**Focused on Visual Exploration, Learning, and User Feedback**

Aperture Viewer, focused on visual exploration, learning, and user feedback, is tailored for virtual photographers and videomakers interested in next-generation visuals in Second Life/OpenSim. It offers a platform for innovative rendering experiments and the enhanced Phototools system by William Weaver. Beyond code, Aperture Viewer is a valuable learning resource. Features are developmental, with no guarantee of Firestorm integration.

For those unfamiliar with William Weaver's virtual photography and videomaking work, see examples on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@colorscompletely/featured) and in these online photobooks:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>**Important Disclaimer:** **Aperture Viewer is not a substitute for Firestorm Viewer for general use and is not supported by Linden Lab or the Firestorm Viewer Project.** This is an independent, community-developed *test* project based on the open-source Firestorm Viewer code, intended for visual experimentation, user feedback, and as a learning resource.
>*   **Open Source Based on Firestorm:** Like Firestorm, this viewer is derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client. The client codebase has been open source since 2007 and is available under the LGPL license. This project continues to be open and welcomes contributions within its focused scope.
>*   **Alpha Software:** Aperture Viewer is currently in **Alpha development**. Expect instability, bugs, and incomplete features. It is provided for **testing and early access purposes only.**
>*   **Hardware Demands:** Aperture Viewer may include experimental features that are **demanding on computer hardware.** Performance may vary, and you may need a powerful system to run it smoothly at higher settings.

## Credits

**Aperture Viewer is built upon the foundation of the Firestorm Viewer Project and utilizes code from Firestorm.**  This independent project would not be possible without the immense and ongoing work of the Firestorm team, who have created and maintain a robust and open-source viewer codebase.  We gratefully acknowledge their contributions to the Second Life and OpenSim communities.

We also extend our sincere appreciation to **Linden Lab and their developers and staff** for their foundational commitment to open source and for creating the Second Life platform that enables independent projects like Aperture Viewer to exist.

Aperture Viewer is maintained by William Weaver and is an independent project focused on visual experimentation. The Phototools system, a key area of focus, builds upon the original Phototools design by William Weaver.
